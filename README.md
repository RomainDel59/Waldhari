Looking to build your empire in Los Santos? Your lucky day has arrived! 
Waldhari Corporation, the powerhouse behind some of the city's most lucrative operations, 
is making the brilliant decision to relocate to Provence, France - 
undoubtedly the most beautiful country in the world.

What does this mean for you? Their entire American portfolio is up for grabs! 
From pristine legitimate enterprises to... shall we say, more adventurous business ventures, 
everything must go!

Available properties include:

targets – make them work for their paychecks again!
